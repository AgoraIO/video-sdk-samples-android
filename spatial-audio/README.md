# 3D Spatial Audio

3D Spatial Audio brings theater-like effects to Video Calling, making it seem as if the sound originates from all around the user. Video SDK provides spatial audio effects that give users an immersive audio experience in scenarios such as e-sports competitions, and online conferences.

This sample project shows you how to implement 3D spatial audio in your client.
