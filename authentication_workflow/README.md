#  Secure authentication with tokens

Authentication is the act of validating the identity of each user before they access a system. Agora uses digital tokens to authenticate users and their privileges before they access Agora SD-RTNâ„¢ to join Video Calling. Each token is valid for a limited period and works only for a specific channel. For example, you cannot use the token generated for a channel called AgoraChannel to join the AppTest channel.

This project shows you how to retrieve a token from an authentication server, and use it to connect securely to a specific Video Calling channel.
