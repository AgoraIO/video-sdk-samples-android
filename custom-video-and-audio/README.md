# Custom video and audio sources

By default, Video SDK uses the basic audio and video modules on the device your app runs on. However, there are certain scenarios where you want to integrate a custom audio or video source into your app, such as:

- Your app has its own audio or video module.
- You want to use a non-camera source, such as recorded screen data.
- You need to process the captured audio or video with a pre-processing library for audio or image enhancement.
- You need flexible device resource allocation to avoid conflicts with other services.

This sample project shows you to push custom audio and video to a channel.
