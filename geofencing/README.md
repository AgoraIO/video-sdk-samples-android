# Geofencing

When a user joins a channel, Video SDK automatically connects them to the closest geographical region of Agora SD-RTN™. However, to meet the laws and regulations of your region, you may want to filter in or filter out connections to a specific geographical region. Agora geofencing enables you to control and customize data routing in your app by specifying the Agora SD-RTN™ region users connect to.

This sample project shows you how to enable Geofencing in your client.
