# SDK quickstart

Video SDK enables one-to-one or small-group video chat connections with smooth, jitter-free streaming video. Agora’s Video SDK makes it easy to embed real-time video chat into web, mobile, and native apps.

Thanks to Agora’s intelligent and global Software Defined Real-time Network ([Agora SD-RTN™](https://docs.agora.io/en/video-calling/overview/core-concepts#agora-sd-rtn)), you can rely on the highest available video and audio quality.

This page provides a sample project with best-practice code that illustrates the integration of high-quality, low-latency Video SDK features into an app using Video SDK.
