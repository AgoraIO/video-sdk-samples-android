# Raw video and audio processing

In some scenarios, raw audio and video captured through the camera and microphone must be processed to achieve the desired functionality or to enhance the user experience. Video SDK enables you to pre-process and post-process the captured audio and video data for implementation of custom playback effects.

This sample project shows you how to implement raw video and audio processing in your client.

## Understand the code
