# AgoraManager

The `AgoraManager` class encapsulates the basic logic to setup the Agora SDK, join, and leave a channel. All projects in this repository extend the `AgoraManager` class to add specific functionality for that project.

Additionally, the `agora_manager` folder includes the essential UI components for the quickstart project. All projects within this repository build upon the quickstart UI layout to incorporate additional UI elements required to showcase specific functionalities.
