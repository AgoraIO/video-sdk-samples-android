# Agora Video SDK documentation sample projects

To run the sample projects in this folder, take the following steps:

1. Clone the Git repository by executing the following command in a terminal window:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AgoraIO/video-sdk-samples-android
    ```

1. Launch Android Studio. From the **File** menu select **Open...** and navigate to the desired project folder under `video-sdk-samples-android/Docs-Examples/`

1. Connect an Android device to your development device.

1. In Android Studio, click **Run app**. A moment later, you see the project installed on your device.

1. Refer to the README file in the project folder for further information.


Each folder contains the runnable code explained in the documentation.

    Advantages are that we supply runnable code where the UI is abstracted so we concentrate more clearly on Agora SDK. This means the docs become much shorter and simpler. Possible disadvantage is that we have to write the code for the project. TBH, we already have the code, we are just putting it in a better format for learning.
